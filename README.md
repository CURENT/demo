# Demonstration for CURENT LTB

A collection of demonstrations related to CURENT LTB. The demonstrations aim to showcase the capabilities and features of CURENT LTB.

# Demo list

## Charging time constrained EV SFR Provision

This demo demonstrates the effective provision of secondary frequency regulation to Electric Vehicles that are constrained by charging time. The goal is to show how this can be achieved in real-time scenarios and how it can benefit power systems.

Researcher and Demonstrator: Jinning Wang

## Virtual inertia scheduling from IBR

This demo showcases the real-time economic dispatch of power systems that are penetrated by IBR, while also considering virtual inertia scheduling. The goal is to demonstrate how virtual inertia scheduling can be used to improve the performance of power systems.

Researcher: Buxin She
