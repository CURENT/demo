# Interfacing ANDES Through Two Buses Using a Perturbation File

## Overview

This demo shows how to interface with ANDES using a perturbation file. It provides a method to interact with ANDES through connected buses to verify your own model.

## Purpose

To validate a two-end HVDC line model using a perturbation file, which simplifies the process of modeling and simulation.

## Method

1. **Model Setup**:
   - The 'from' end is modeled as a load.
   - The 'to' end is modeled as a generator.

2. **Control**:
   - The HVDC line can be controlled by adjusting the power at the 'from' end and the voltage and power at the 'to' end.

## Additional Information

More details about perturbation can be found in the ANDES Documentation.
